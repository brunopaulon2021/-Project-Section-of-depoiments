      <p>
        Testimonials can be a great marketing tool for any business. Whether
        you were approached to write one, or decided on your own, your
        testimony needs to be as detailed and persuasive as possible. To make
        a strong statement, start by describing the problem, then explain how
        the contracted product or service resolved the issue. End with a
        recommendation.

          <h1>Michele Campos</h1>
          <h6>Administrative assistant</h6>
        </article>
        <span><b>Appreciate the work of others.</b></span>
      </div>

      <p>
        If the person responsible for the service paid special attention, or
        if the company went above and beyond what was expected, write about
        it.

          <h1>Vitor Oliveira</h1>
          <h6>Administrative assistant</h6>
        </article>
        <span><b>Make it clear whether it indicates the product or service.</b></span>
      </div>
      <p>
        It may seem obvious, but the best testimonial is the one that
        specifically says whether or not you recommend the product or service
        you hired.

        </article>
        <span><b>Should my testimonial be extensive?</b></span>
      </div>
      <p>
        The amount and type of information to include about you will depend on
        the product or service provided. The testimony needs to be relatively
        short, so it's important to leave out irrelevant information.

      </div>
      <p>
        Personal comments mean a lot to the people they are directed to, and
        can help employers identify and reward the best employees. If someone
        has left you positively impressed, mention the person in the
        testimonial.
